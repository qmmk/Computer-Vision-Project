# Computer Vision Project

* a.Painting detection: predict a ROI for each painting
```
Versione 1_0 -> presente Gabor,adapative, NO CCL
Versione 1_1 -> rimosso Gabor, si adapative, si CCL (note: lento)
Versione 1_3 -> otsu e convex hull

```
* b.Painting rectification: correct the perspective distortion of each painting 
* c. Painting retrieval: match each detected painting to the paintings DB 
* d.People detection: predict a ROI around each person 
* e.People localization: assign each person to one room on the map
